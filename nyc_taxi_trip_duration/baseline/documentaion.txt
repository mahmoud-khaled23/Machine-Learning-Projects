- baseline model steps
1- load dataset
2- drop non-necessary columns
3- split cat & numerical features
4- split dataset to (X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val)
5- encode cat features with (OHE)
6- replace the categorical features with it's transformed features
7- transform the DataFrame(X_train, X_val, y_train and y_val) to numpy array
8- scale data # here we need to think about (deal with) pandas datetime
